# Teaching and Learning with Jupyter Book Review

:+1:

* Description of the use cases
* Screenshots of examples of activities/questions in notebooks (e.g. in Section [2](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/why-we-use-jupyter-notebooks.html#why-do-we-use-jupyter).3.22.
* Inclusion of 'pro-tips content' throughout content
* I do like the pedagogical patterns section, though I see how including something like this greatly increases the scope of our project. I think what I like most about it, is that they're concrete examples of creative use-cases.
* The [tips and tricks section](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/jupyter.html#tips-and-tricks) I find to be useful, practical advice. In thinking of how this applies toour own project, I think a lot of this could be condensed into little "tips" boxes.
* Different ways of running Jupyter w/ pros and cons. Useful for educators to know ahead of time


:-1:

* Needs way more color, pictures, graphics. I think there is too much text for this to be an effective way of "selling" the notebooks. You have to read a lot of prefaces before you get to the practical implementations and concrete examples.
* Tone is kinda dry
* Not sure if it's the layout, but I think just by nature of it being a book, it doesn't feel like as a user that I can or should skip around to only the sections I need. It's hard to know which sections will be most useful to me when I "arrive" to this resource.
