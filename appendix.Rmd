# Outline of Content & Deliverables

## Works in Progress

The table below shows the tutorials that are in progress or soon-to-be in progress.
  
  [WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE/ CODE THIS TABLE? ]
  
```{r library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(DT)
library(tidyverse)
```
<!--
```{r create_tbl, include=FALSE}

    ~Tool,        ~Tutorial,         ~'Demo Site',          ~Repo,

```{r use_dt, echo=FALSE}

Now, coding the table a second way, so as not to use HTML explicitly. But now everything is a link.

# Teaching and Learning with Jupyter Book Review

Here is Desiree's impression of the Jupyter Book. 


__Good stuff__

* Description of the use cases
* Screenshots of examples of activities/questions in notebooks (e.g. in Section [2](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/why-we-use-jupyter-notebooks.html#why-do-we-use-jupyter).3.22.
* Inclusion of 'pro-tips content' throughout content
* I do like the pedagogical patterns section, though I see how including something like this greatly increases the scope of our project. I think what I like most about it, is that they're concrete examples of creative use-cases.
* The [tips and tricks section](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/jupyter.html#tips-and-tricks) I find to be useful, practical advice. In thinking of how this applies toour own project, I think a lot of this could be condensed into little "tips" boxes.
* Different ways of running Jupyter w/ pros and cons. Useful for educators to know ahead of time


__Stuff I don't like as much__

* Needs way more color, pictures, graphics. I think there is too much text for this to be an effective way of "selling" the notebooks. You have to read a lot of prefaces before you get to the practical implementations and concrete examples.
* Tone is kinda dry
* Not sure if it's the layout, but I think just by nature of it being a book, it doesn't feel like as a user that I can or should skip around to only the sections I need. It's hard to know which sections will be most useful to me when I "arrive" to this resource.

# General Bookdown Questions

* What is the main takeaway from the `<meta>` tags (slide 25) in the bookdown workshop/tutorial?

# What should I make {#teach-offer}

```{r child = "modules/clickable-toc.Rmd"}

```

I think that quite early on in this book, we should try to answer the question "I'm an educator...what should/can I make here?".  
I'm not sure whether this should happen here or in the preface, but one way we can do this is with the flowchart. Below is just a *very rough* conceptual sketch of how a flowchart here might be a fun way to give users a visual map of where they could end up after using the rstudio4edu resource. [This is the idea I'm riffing off of.](https://www.beckysimpson.co/flowcharts) 

Needless to say, right now the example below is yucky, too small, and incomplete. And it's also just kind of acting as funny eye-candy. But if we make it nicer (and perhaps summarize it more efficiently with a table beneath it), would this be the spot for it? (Could alternatively place this in the introductory section for the Cookbooks Section--and only include tools that we have cookbooks for (ie. leave out stuff like Connect)).

![](images/flowchart.jpg)

# Teaching learners {#teach-learners}

+ teaching to make reprexes

+ teaching about community/SO/etc

# What to do on day 1 {#teach-day1}

See: https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/issues/47

- Link to mine's eat cake first stuff.
- start with a data package (if you can); caveat: you are teaching importing data.
- link to mine's dsinabox, perhaps garrett's latest repro research stuff
- orient to IDE (great tip by kierisi: play with RStudio IDE themes?)
- start with Rmd (if you can)- you can teach minimal markdown etc.

# Licensing your content

Some opinionated guidance.

Does it make sense to move the Licensing section closer to the end of the book-- after they've created new content (or remixed ours or others') with the cookbooks?

# Remixing licensed content

Recommended ways to offer attribution

If you are reusing others' content in say a workshop with slides, add your attributions on the last slide, and include an "Attributions" section in the repository's READ ME file.

So if it’s a workshop, once on the last slide + in the repo readme. 

If it’s a semester long course, just somewhere on the course website
